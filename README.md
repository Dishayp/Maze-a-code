# Maze-a-code
Name and Code Obfuscator (For java only)

##Synopsis
Obfuscates a java file by replacing all function names and function calls with random strings. It also performs code obfuscation i.e inserts bogus code and bogus functions while introducing multiple jumps. The bogus code can be specified and the number of bogus codes can be varied. Run the file and a '-obfuscated' file is created in the same path.

## Limitations
* A main function should be present in the code.
* The main function should be the first function in the code.
* Variable names are not obfuscated, only function names are.
* Limited to java codes only.

##Example
Code before obfuscation: https://postimg.org/image/6ozbz85zr/

After running through the code: https://postimg.org/image/wykei0rx3/
